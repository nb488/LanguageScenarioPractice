# "plotTwist" Language Web App

## Project Description

PlotTwist is a personalized language-learning app that generates conversation scenarios based on user-specified situations (e.g., ordering at a restaurant, buying groceries). The user selects a language, proficiency level, and scenario, and the app creates dynamic prompts and responses tailored to their inputs. It’s designed to help learners practice new and realistic interactions and build confidence with practical phrases and situations.
