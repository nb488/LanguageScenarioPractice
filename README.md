## User Stories
- As a new user, I want to sign up and log in so I can access and practice my scripts.
- As a logged-in user, I want to save my progress and scripts so I can view them later.
- As a logged-in user, I want to have access to key vocabulary based of my scripts.
- As a logged-in user, I want my answers to be checked for correctness and relevancy based on script prompts.
    - Note this may be a future implementation, but users should be able to have access to the expected responses generated by the program to self-check. 
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to see my progress statistics, such as accuracy and habits. (Future implementation)
