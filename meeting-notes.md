# Meeting Notes 


### Oct 4, 2025

Brief meeting with mentor Charlie to discuss topic for project, a language-based program that uses AI to build language scripts based on user prompts. 
- suggestions : build skills in React, and future changes could implement data analytics and database management

More ideas for project:
- implement ways for the user to practice key vocabulary. May use NLP to retrieve words from the script.
- ideally users can save thier scripts to a profile.
- start with text responses to the script when the user interacts with the program/script. Future work could use voice-recognition, having the program respond to voice answers from the user.
